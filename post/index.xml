      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an extrovert and have a very easy-going attitude to life. In my spare time, I always jog, swim, and play computer games with my friends. Sometimes I would participate in competitions such as a miniMarathon:&lt;img src=&#34;race.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;race&#34;&gt;
I can play several Chinese traditional musical instruments like the bamboo flute and hulusi. Recently I&amp;rsquo;m learning how to play the guitar and ukulele. Hope I can play a complete tune before graduation. I am also a rookie in painting, you can find some of my works in gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

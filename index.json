We trained all labeled and unlabeled data via Graph Convolutional Network models to improve explainability and rationality.

By mining multi-hop relations (named as path) between user-item interactions within a KG, implicit user preference and other side information can be clearly uncovered. Nevertheless, existing recommendation methods not only have fundamental limitations in explainability, but also underutilize user-item path sets and show poor performance in handling cold-start issues, which indicates reliable recommendation results require massive prior knowledge. To better address these issues, we propose a novel model architecture named Path-enhanced Recurrent Network (PeRN). Specifically, PeRN integrates a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder with an meta-path-based entropy encoder to further increase explainability and reduce cold-start costs. RNN-based model has a strong ability to represent sequential path semantics in KG, while entropy encoder, as an efficient statistical analysis approach, leverage meta path information to differentiate paths in one user-item interaction. Moreover, we improve previous path extraction algorithms with a bidirectional scheme to make PeRN more feasible. Comprehensive experiment results on two real-world datasets, compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrate our significant improvements with reasonable explanations and minimal amount of prior knowledge in constructing KG.","tags":["In submission"],"title":"Path-enhanced Explainable Recommendation with Knowledge Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Recommender system helps us to obtain information/products that interest us more.

By mining multi-hop relations (named as path) between user-item interactions within a KG, implicit user preference and other side information can be clearly uncovered. Nevertheless, existing recommendation methods not only have fundamental limitations in explainability, but also underutilize user-item path sets and show poor performance in handling cold-start issues, which indicates reliable recommendation results require massive prior knowledge. To better address these issues, we propose a novel model architecture named Path-enhanced Recurrent Network (PeRN). Specifically, PeRN integrates a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder with an meta-path-based entropy encoder to further increase explainability and reduce cold-start costs. RNN-based model has a strong ability to represent sequential path semantics in KG, while entropy encoder, as an efficient statistical analysis approach, leverage meta path information to differentiate paths in one user-item interaction. Moreover, we improve previous path extraction algorithms with a bidirectional scheme to make PeRN more feasible. Comprehensive experiment results on two real-world datasets, compared with several state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrate our significant improvements with reasonable explanations and minimal amount of prior knowledge in constructing KG.","tags":["In submission"],"title":"Path-enhanced Explainable Recommendation with Knowledge Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiying Xu","Shihui Song","Zhanshan Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598952512,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598952512,"objectID":"10aacb5f06e38baa93689a7cc6bf1912","permalink":"https://songshsongsh.github.io/publication/maxrpc/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T17:28:32+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/maxrpc/","section":"publication","summary":"Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be widely applied in many areas. This paper investigates the maximum restricted path consistency algorithm. There is a large quantity of useless checks in the process of searching for a PC-support with the most popular algorithm lmaxRPC3rm. Since lmaxRPC3rm has to examine the whole domain of a variable to ascertain whether a PC-support exists. The efficiency of the search can be improved by eliminating such useless checks. Firstly, this paper analyses the features which accounts for the existence of these ineffective checks. And then, this paper discusses some methods of solving these problems. Afterwards, a new data structure is put forward to strengthen residual supports and weaken the use of multidirectionality to narrow the range of search. A new algorithm, lmaxRPCls, which exploits the results above is proposed and it is proved that lmaxRPCls is correct and complete. It is also proved that the time complexity of this new algorithm is better than that of lmaxRPC3rm. Experimental results show that lmaxRPCls performs better in most benchmark instances and it can improve the performance by 65% in the best case.","tags":[],"title":"lmaxRPCls: An Algorithm Utilizing Light Symmetry for Approximating maxRPC in Constraint Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am an extrovert and have a very easy-going attitude to life.
